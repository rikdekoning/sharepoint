# Privacy Policy — SP Reveal

**Last updated: February 2026**

SP Reveal is a browser extension designed to enhance productivity when working with SharePoint Online lists and items. This policy explains what information the extension accesses, how it is used, and how your privacy is protected.

---

## 1. Overview

SP Reveal processes information **only within your browser**, and **no data ever leaves your device**.  
The extension does **not** collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal or organizational information.

---

## 2. Data Collection

SP Reveal **does not collect any data**.

Specifically, the extension does **not**:

- collect personal data  
- collect Microsoft 365 tenant information  
- collect SharePoint content  
- collect browsing history  
- create usage logs  
- send analytics  
- use cookies  
- communicate with external servers  

All operations occur locally in the browser.

---

## 3. Data Usage

The extension reads certain elements of the active SharePoint page **only when the user interacts with it**. Examples include:

- reading form field labels to display internal field names  
- reading list and item metadata to build URLs  
- reading item data when showing all fields  
- reading SharePoint REST API responses that the user already has permission to access  

This information is used **only to perform the requested action** (e.g., copy a URL, duplicate an item) and is **never stored or transmitted**.

---

## 4. Permissions Explained

SP Reveal requests browser permissions solely to support its core functionality:

- **activeTab / tabs** — to send commands to the current SharePoint tab.  
- **scripting** — to inject the content script that interacts with SharePoint forms.  
- **storage** — to save minimal non‑sensitive settings (e.g., manual item ID).  
- **clipboardWrite** — to copy URLs, GUIDs, IDs, and internal names at the user’s request.  
- **host permissions** — required to access and read SharePoint page metadata.

These permissions **do not grant the extension access to personal information** beyond what is already visible to the user on the SharePoint page.

---

## 5. Data Storage

The extension only stores:

- lightweight local preferences (e.g., a manually entered item ID)

No SharePoint data or user information is ever stored locally or remotely.

All stored data remains on the user’s device and can be cleared at any time by:

- removing the extension, or  
- clearing browser extension storage  

---

## 6. Third-Party Sharing

SP Reveal does **not** share data with:

- third parties  
- external APIs  
- analytics services  
- advertisers  
- cloud servers  

There is **no** network communication except calls made directly to SharePoint sites the user is already authenticated to.

---

## 7. Security

Because SP Reveal does not transmit data, security risk is minimal. The extension:

- operates only on approved SharePoint Online domains  
- cannot access sites outside SharePoint  
- cannot bypass user permissions in SharePoint  
- cannot access SharePoint without the user being logged in  
- runs entirely in the browser sandbox  

Users maintain full control of their data at all times.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated as the extension evolves. The latest version will always be available in the GitHub repository.
